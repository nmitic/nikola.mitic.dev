Namics, as a company which is well established added so much to my experience as a developer. I was working on small and big project, ranging from 2 to 10 team members in agile like setup. I also worked on legacy project as well as project which used latest FE stack such as React|Redux|Webpack.

Main focus of projects was e commerce and working with sensitive data inside Banking environment.

I also had an opportunity to share my knowledge between all teams by holding workshops, and being responsible for junior level developers, making sure they are properly onboarded on the project and making sure they are following project standards.

Sunrise

I was onboarded quite late to the project so I was giving the task of refactoring previously builded React components and developing few new features. Project had a really nicely defined processes, since the UI part was build by other company we had to implement their code into our application which then acted as a widgets on AEM powered website.

Nettoshop

Nettoshop as a legacy project had its own set of challenges, manly how do you implement new feature which requires latest Front End standard on a project which wasn't build to support those latest standard in the first place.

I ended up writing a lot of polyfills myself and tying to gracefully degrade features as much as possible.
