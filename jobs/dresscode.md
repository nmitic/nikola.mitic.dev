# Frontend developer

**My** main responsibility during my employment in Dresscode was converting design files such as PSD into static websites templates using html, css and javascript, and latter into CMS systems, such as Wordpress. Although my main focus as a developer was always on front end technologies in order to integrate static templates into wordpress I needed to get familiar with whole wordpress ecosystem and also php as a programing language, which was great experience from which I have learned a lot, but most importantly ability to look at the bigger picture plus diving into other programing languages is always fun.
