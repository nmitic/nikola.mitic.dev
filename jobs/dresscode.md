# Web Developer

### Dresscode

### Location: Serbia, Belgrade, Remote

##### Mar. 2013 - Jan. 2016

During my tenure at Dresscode, my primary role was to accomplish the conversion of design files, specifically PSD, into dynamic website templates. Through my utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I successfully transformed these static templates into CMS systems like WordPress.

While my primary focus revolved around front-end technologies, I recognized the necessity of delving into the entirety of the WordPress ecosystem and getting to know PHP as a programming language. This valuable experience not only broadened my perspective but also enhanced my ability to comprehend the larger scope of web development. Exploring different programming languages has always been an enjoyable endeavor, allowing me to continuously expand my skill set.
