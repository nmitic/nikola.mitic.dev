### 10 WAYS TO RUIN YOUR LIFE

Rarely do I meet someone who is intentionally trying to ruin their life. On occasion, someone might be trying to gain attention by intentionally making bad choices. But most of the time, we ruin our lives without realizing it.

While there isn’t an easy formula to success, failure is much more predictable. Some actions are almost guaranteed to lead to destruction.

** Here are 10 ways to ruin your life: **

1. Assume your problems are unique. When you think your issues are unique, it excuses you from taking action. Instead of knowing everyone has problems, you can think you have been dealt a uniquely bad hand which no one can understand. Instead of learning from others and getting help, you can wallow in self-pity. Instead of finding common ground with others who have overcome obstacles, you can look for the ways they had it easier than you. (See: When You Feel What No One Else Has Ever Felt)

2. Wait for someone to help you. Just wait. Don’t act. Don’t plan. Don’t grow so weary of your situation that you have to do something. Assume your problems are supposed to be solved by someone else. Expect your parents or siblings or friends or employer or government to save you. Until the cavalry comes, just do nothing.

3. Cope with your pain in a way that adds to the pain. We all have sorrow and we all must find ways to deal with that pain. If you want to ruin your life, cope in such a way that adds to your sorrow. Find something which masks your pain–a bad relationship, an addiction, or some escape mechanism. Never get to the root causes of a situation.

4. Fixate on immediate comfort. Forget the long-road. Do whatever is easiest now. Avoid anything which might be difficult. Always take the avenue which leads to the quickest experience of ease, comfort, and peace. Avoid conflict, dodge the truth, and tell whatever lie is necessary in the moment.
